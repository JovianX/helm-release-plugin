# Helm3 Plugin `helm-release`

`helm-release` is a Helm 3 plugin that allows running operations on Helm releases (deployed Helm charts).

### ‚ú® Features:

 * üì• [PULL](#helm-release-pull) to pull (re-create) Helm charts from a deployed helm release.
 * üìÑ [UPGRADE](#helm-release-upgrade) to Update values of a deployed release, without providing the chart used for release deployment.
 * ‚è≥ [TTL](#helm-release-ttl) to schedule an uninstallation/removal/deletion of a release. [Article](https://dev.to/rtpro/helm-release-time-to-livettl-for-temporary-environments-1239)

### ü´∂ Common use-Cases:
 * Redeploy a release on another cluster or namespace with the same helm chart.
 * Update values of a release, when you are not sure what exact chart version was used, or you don't have access to the original helm chart (Contrary to the `helm upgrade` command which requires the chart).
 * configure temporary or ephemeral helm releases so they are automatically deleted after some time and not forgotten on the cluster forever. 

## Getting started
### Installation
To install the plugin:
```shell
helm plugin install https://github.com/JovianX/helm-release-plugin
```

>
> Dependencies: `helm-release` plugin depends on:
>>      jq - a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.
>>             Install: https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/
>

Update to the latest version:
```shell
$ helm plugin update release
```
Verify it's been installed:
```shell
$ helm plugin list
NAME    VERSION DESCRIPTION
...
release 0.3.2   Update values of a release, pull charts from releases
...
```


### Usage

```
$ helm release
usage: helm release [ pull | upgrade ]
```
Available Commands:
* __pull__ - Pulls (re-create) the Helm chart from a deployed Helm release.
* __upgrade__ - Updates Helm release values without the Helm chart.
* __ttl__ - Sets release time to live(TTL) to schedule release automatic delete.

>
> Note: Setting Namespace and Context are supported via helm native flags
> ```
> -n, --namespace string            namespace scope for this request`
>     --kube-context string         name of the kubeconfig context to use
>  ```
>



### `helm release pull`

Pulls (re-create) a Helm chart from a deployed Helm release.

```
$ helm release pull
usage: helm release pull <RELEASE NAME> [-d | --destination <TARGET CHART DIRECTORY>] [-o | --output [yaml | json | text]]
```

Example:
```
$ helm --namespace nginx release pull nginx --destination /home/me/helm-charts
Chart saved to nginx-ingress-0.13.2

$ ls /home/me/helm-charts/nginx-ingress-0.13.2/
Chart.yaml  crds  README.md  templates  values-icp.yaml  values-nsm.yaml  values-plus.yaml  values.yaml
```
>
>Note: Setting namespace`[-n | --namespace ]` or context `[--context]` name as needed) 
>
### `helm release upgrade`

Update the Helm release values, without specifying the helm chart. The `helm release upgrade` command accepts the same parameters as `helm upgrade` without specifying the helm chart. `--destination` is an optional parameter to set the directory where the chart is saved, defaults to `/tmp`. After the release is updated the chart is deleted. We recommend setting the `--reuse-values` flag to keep existing values and provide only the values you would like to change.
```
$ helm release upgrade
Update release values without specifying the Helm Chart. Usage: helm release upgrade [RELEASE NAME] [-d | --destination <TARGET CHART DIRECTORY>] [helm upgrade arguments]
```

Example:
```
helm release upgrade rabbitmq --namespace=rabbitmq --set=key1=value1 --reuse-values
...
... standard helm upgrade output ...
Update Complete. ‚éàHappy Helming!‚éà
```


### `helm release ttl`
Sets release time-to-live(TTL) to schedule automatic release uninstallation. `release ttl` uses Kubernetes CronJob to schedule automatic uninstallation of releases. Helm release TTL supports actions: **set**, **unset** and **get** TTL for a helm release.

#### GET TTL
To get the current TTL of a release pass the `<RELEASE NAME>`. 
```
helm release ttl <RELEASE NAME>
```

Supproted outputs: `text`(defaul), `yaml` and `json`. 
For example, to see when `redis` release is scheduled for deletion, run:
```
helm release ttl redis
Scheduled release removal date: Tue Aug 30 20:12:00 EEST 2022
```
Same request with `json` output:
```
helm release ttl redis --output=json
{"scheduled_date": "2022-08-30 17:12"}
```
Same request with `yaml` output:
```
helm release ttl redis --output=yaml
scheduled_date: 2022-08-30 17:12
```

| Note: Dates returned in cluster timezone (default UTC). |
| --- |


#### SET TTL

Sets the TTL of a release, after which the release is deleted. Provide `<RELEASE-NAME>` and  `--set` to set the release TTL time using `date` format.
```
helm release ttl <RELEASE NAME> --set <DATE>
```

 For example to schedule deletion of a release in `five minutes, run:
```
helm release ttl redis --set='5 minutes'
cronjob.batch/redis-ttl created
```
> Refer to complete `<DATA>` [documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/ coreutils/manual/html_node/Relative-items-in-date-strings.html) for
> detailed description of possible time delta options.

If TTL is configured (CronJob exists) and the `--set` command is executed again the TTL(CronJob) will be rescheduled:
```
helm release ttl redis --set='5 minutes'
cronjob.batch/redis-ttl configured
```

#### UNSET TTL
To remove release TTL pass `<RELEASE NAME>` and `--unset` flag. 
```
helm release ttl <RELEASE NAME> --unset
```


For example, to remove `redis` release TTL run:
```
helm release ttl redis --unset
cronjob.batch "redis-ttl" deleted
```

##### Service Account
You can specify which service account should be used once the TTL has expired. The `default` service account is used, unless otherwise specified which is highly recommended. You can specify the service account with the `--service-account` parameter. Note this is only used in the job context when the TTL has expired and the cleanup is triggered.

```
helm release ttl redis --service-account='my-privileged-serviceaccount' --set='5 minutes'
```

Example service account (needs to be provisioned/created separately)
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: my-privileged-serviceaccount
  namespace: default
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: my-privileged-serviceaccount
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: my-privileged-serviceaccount
    namespace: default
```
