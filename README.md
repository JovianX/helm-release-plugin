`helm-release` is a Helm 3 plugin that allows running operations on Helm releases (deployed Helm charts).

Features:

 * Pull (re-create) Helm charts from a deployed helm release.
 * Update values of a deployed release, without providing the chart used for release deployment.

Common use-Cases:
 * Redeploy a release on another cluster or namespace with the same helm chart.
 * Update values of a release, when you are not sure what exact chart version was used, or you don't have access to the original helm chart (Contrary to the `helm upgrade` command which requires the chart).

## Getting started
### Installation
To install the plugin:
```shell
helm plugin install https://github.com/JovianX/helm-release-plugin
```

>
> Dependencies: `helm-release` plugin depends on:
>>      jq - a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.
>>             Install: https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/
>

Update to the latest version:
```shell
$ helm plugin update release
```
Verify it's been installed:
```shell
$ helm plugin list
NAME    VERSION DESCRIPTION
...
release 0.3.2   Update values of a release, pull charts from releases
...
```


### Usage

```
$ helm release

usage: helm release [ pull | upgrade ]
```
Available Commands:
* __pull__ - Pulls (re-create) a Helm chart from a deployed Helm release
* __upgrade__ - Behaves the same as `helm upgrade`, but doesn't require the helm chart. The Chart is pulled from the release (`helm release pull`).

### `helm release pull`

```
$ helm release pull
usage: helm release pull <RELEASE NAME> [-d | --destination <TARGET CHART DIRECTORY>] [-o | --output [yaml | json | text]]
```

Example:
```
$ helm --namespace nginx release pull nginx --destination /home/me/helm-charts
Chart saved to nginx-ingress-0.13.2

$ ls /home/me/helm-charts/nginx-ingress-0.13.2/
Chart.yaml  crds  README.md  templates  values-icp.yaml  values-nsm.yaml  values-plus.yaml  values.yaml
```


### `helm release upgrade`

This command accepts the same parameters as `helm upgrade`  except specifying the helm chart. As an optional parameter you can pass `--destination` directory where the chart will be dumped, by default chart dumped to `/tmp`. After release update chart will be deleted.
```
$ helm release upgrade
Helper for helm upgrade, that doesn't require to provide original helm chart. Usage: helm release upgrade [RELEASE NAME] [-d | --destination <TARGET CHART DIRECTORY>] [helm upgrade arguments]
```

Example:
```
helm release upgrade rabbitmq --namespace=rabbitmq --set=key1=value1 --reuse-values
...
... standard helm upgrade output ...
Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈
```
